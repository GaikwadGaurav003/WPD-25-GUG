        Information:A car, or an automobile,
        is a motor vehicle with wheels. Most
        definitions of cars state that they
        run primarily on roads, seat one to
        eight people, have four wheels, and
        mainly transport people rather than
        cargo. There are around one billion
        cars in use worldwide.
